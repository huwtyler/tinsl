			<h2>Welcome to <span class="tinsl-text">TINSL</span></h2>
			<p>And welcome to the North Pole, we are elves from Santa's Technology, Innovation and New Skills Laboratory. Each Christmas, we invest in people with ideas that could make Christmas better for everyone. We do this by providing tools and kits that encourage wonderful people to invent, innovate and create!</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="section red">
			<p>Here are some of the best ideas and inventions from people that TINSL have invested in since it was founded in 1827... </p>

				<li class="item">
					<span class="date">1827</span>
					<div class="item-invention">
						<p class="item-title">Pigs in Blankets</p>
						<p class="item-inventor">Samuel Higginsbottom</p>
						<p>TINSL'S first investment was in 1827 before technology meant electronics. Sam 'Porky' Higginsbottom's invention revolutionised the Christmas dinner by combining pork sausages with bacon.</p>

					<span class="date">1844</span>

						<p class="item-title">Telephone</p>
						<p class="item-inventor">Alexander Graham Bell</p>
						<p>TINSL invested in Bell by providing a small transistor kit when he was a young boy. Years later, the telephone has meant that millions of people can connect and share good wishes on Christmas day with friends and family.</p>

			<p>People often ask how our elves know who TINSL should invest in. Over the years we've developed our own gadgets to identify those with potential in the field of technology and innovation. Our "BOTS" are just one of these pieces of equipment...</p>
